## Introduction

Koi-Koi is a traditional Japanese card game played with Hanafuda cards. The goal of the game is to match cards from the same month and form specific combinations to score points. The charm of Hanafuda cards lies not only in their intricate and beautiful designs but also in how different they are from European playing cards. A notable fact about Koi-Koi is that itâ€™s not only beloved by many, but it also marks the origin of Nintendo, one of todays biggests video game companies.
